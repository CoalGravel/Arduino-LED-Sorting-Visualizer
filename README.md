# Arduino-LED-Sorting-Visualizer

Run visualizer.ino on an arduino with a WS2812b compatible LED strip connected and watch the rainbow get scrambled then put back in order via the quicksort algorithm.

Other algorithms are implemented too, simply exchange the quicksort function call with whichever you fancy.
